# Main file 
Main file is the file that pulls other files from Google Drive. Main file does not have any function or class. It is just pulling functions, instances from other files.

# Utils file
Utils file contains all the transforms, data loaders, code for train-test graphs, misclassified images etc. Everything in this file is a part of a class defined here.

# Network file
This file contains all the train test loops and it connects to the model file in which the network is defined.
